# Working with IPGs and full genome set in the NCBI

TcdA and TcdB classification is based on a subset of sequences identified from the NCBI and SRA.
Homologs identified in the full set can be re-assigned labels (toxin types) through these scripts. This occurs in two stages:

/assignGroups - assigns toxin types to full NCBI set including partial sequences

/getGenomeTree - instructions on how to build C. diff tree from NCBI data

/getIPGs - extracts identical protein groups from NCBI
